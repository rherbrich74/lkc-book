# Source Code for the Learning Kernel Classifiers - Theory and Algorithms Book

This repository contains the source code for all figures and a demo library of functions for classification learning. More details about the book can be found at [here](https://herbrich.me/learning-kernel-classifiers/).

## Figures

Most of the figures from the book have been created using the language [R](https://www.r-project.org/). Note that the codes are designed to output the graphics directly into a postscript file.  Moreover, the output is done into the directory `../../ps/`.

## Learning Kernel Classifiers Toolbox
In addition to the R source code of the figures, I have implemented all algorithms mentioned in Appendix D in R. The PR_LOQO routine was written by [Alexander Smola](https://alex.smola.org/) when at GMD FIRST. In order to use this library, you are required to first compile all the C source codes. On the command line, just type

```
R CMD SHLIB bayes.c
R CMD SHLIB kernels.c
R CMD SHLIB kperc.c
R CMD SHLIB pr_loqo.c
```

In order to the code in R, switch to the main directory and run `source("linear/linear.R")`. Then you can try the examples as follows:
* `exmp.bayes` and `exmp.bayes2` for Bayes point machines.
* `exmp.svm` for Support Vector machines.
* `exmp.nu.svm` for Ï…-support vector learning.
* `exmp.GP.class` for Gaussian process classification.
* `exmp.GP.regress` for Gaussian process regression.
* `exmp.RVM.class` for classification learning with relevance vector machines.
* `exmp.RVM.regress` for regression estimation with relevance vector machines.
* `exmp.fisher` for Fisher discriminants.
* `exmp.perc` for perceptron learning.
